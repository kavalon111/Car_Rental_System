This GitHub repository contains a Java implementation of a simple Car Rental System. It includes classes for cars, customers, rentals, and a central system to manage operations like renting and returning cars. Users interact with the system through a command-line interface where they can rent cars by specifying their name, selecting from available cars, and confirming the rental. They can also return cars by entering the car ID. The system handles basic operations like checking availability, calculating rental prices, and managing rental records. This project serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming in Java and can be expanded for more advanced features or integrated into larger applications.
